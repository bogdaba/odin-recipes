    <li>Cook onions in the reserved grease until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add to bowl with meats.</li>
    <li>Stir meat mixture, bay leaves, and allspice into the cooked beans and bring to a simmer. Add tomatoes, marjoram,
      garlic, salt, and pepper, and continue to simmer, 10 to 15 minutes. Add water if there is not enough liquid in the
      pot.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat, add flour, and stir into a paste. Remove from heat and add to
      stew; stir in paprika powder. Simmer until stew has thickened, about 15 minutes.</li>
